# DataAnalysisCourseWork
This Data Analysis course is offered as a graduate level course work at CERI, University of Memphis. The Course requires students to use multiple programming languages and tools including Python, Matlab, SAC, GMT, Shell Scripting, AWK to analyze data (mainly earthquake time series data). In this repository I am keeping my solutions for class problems, home-works and final project. All the problems were provided by Dr. Eric Daub. To check his profile one can refer to- http://www.memphis.edu/ceri/people/faculty/eric-daub.php
